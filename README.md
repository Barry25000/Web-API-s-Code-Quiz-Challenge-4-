# Web-API-s-Code-Quiz-Challenge-4

# User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

This was a very challenging project for me.
I understand what needs to be done, but I was unable to get my program to work correctly, additionally, I was not able to meet all the criteria.

Even in failure one learns, I will use this as a building block and further my knowledge in JS.
